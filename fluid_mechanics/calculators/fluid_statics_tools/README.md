# Fluid Statics Tools
## The purpose:
1. Calculation of Hydrostatic Pressure
2. Calculation of Area
3. Calculation of Force
4. Hydrostatic Pressure Table
## Imported data:
1. Density ($\rho$): 1100 kg/m³ is used
2. Pressure (P): 20.000.000 Pa (20 MPa) is used
3. Pi: The high precision value was written using 'math' library (No approximations like 3.14).
## Units
All units are in the SI system:
1. Pressure is in **Pa** (Pascal)
2. Density is in **kg/m³**
3. Area is in **m²**
4. Force is in **N** (Newton)
