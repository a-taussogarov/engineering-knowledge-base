# Fluid Dynamics tools
## The purpose:
1. Calculation of fluid velocity based on flowrate and area of the pipe.
2. Determination of Reynolds number of the system.
3. Analysis of friction factor that includes multiple flow regimes (Laminar, Transition and Turbulent).
4. Calculation of total pressure drop including elevation change and friction head losses.
## Imported Data
1. Gravity: 9.81 m/s².
2. Pi: Precise value from 'math' library.
## Units
1. Pressure is in **Pa**.
2. Density is in **kg/m³**.
3. Viscosity is in **Pa*s**.
4. Length, Diameter, Roughness are in **m**.
5. Flowrate is in **m³/s**.
